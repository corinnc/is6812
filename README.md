IS6812 Practice Project - Home Credit Model

Home Credit Default Risk
Business Problem:
Home Credit aims to predict their applicants repayment abilities on loans awarded to the
applicant. They service applicants that struggle to get loans due to the applicants lack of or
nonexistent credit history. Home Credit specialists help these applicants receive loans and
financial services by using a variety of data from the applicants transactional history. Home
Credit needs to accurately monitor and predict applicants repayment capability to ensure
profitability and client acquisition and retention. Home Credit must be able to successfully
approve applicants that are more capable of loan repayment who otherwise would be rejected.
And secondly, avoid awarding loans to applicants who have a higher risk of default to ensure no
loss of profit.
Benefit of a solution:
Home Credit will benefit from a solution by increasing client retention and acquisition. Their
revenue will also increase due to increased business partnerships with loan providers and
increased client retention and acquisition. This project will also help identify applicants who are
at risk of default to ensure no loss in profits.
Success Metrics:
The project will be a success if the probability of default increases of Home Credit baseline
metrics and use those metrics to determine the return on investment and identify increases in
profitability. Achieving this will be an indicator of model success in determining applicants default
risk.
Analytics Approach:
The proposed approach will predict which applicants are most likely and least likely to default on
their loan. We will use a supervised analytic approach, specifically a classification model that
utilizes the clients historical data of previous transactional history and credit history. The data
will include but not limited to: previous credits provided by other financial institutions, monthly
balances of previous credits, monthly balance of previous point of sales and cash loans the
applicant had with Home Credit, monthly balance of previous credit cards, repayment history for
previous loans disbursed, and previous applicants for Home Credit loans. The model will then
be implemented into Home Credit’s application system and used on future applicants.
Scope:
The deliverable for this project will be the probability metrics of applicants most and least likely
to default on their loan. The applicants who are least likely to default on their loan will be offered
assistance in meeting with a financial advisor or loan specialist to discuss loan and financial
service options to help these individuals feel empowered in their repayment journey. Those that
are predicted to default on their loan will still receive assistance by meeting with a financial
advisor or loan specialist to determine where the client can make improvements in their credit
standing so the applicant can reapply for future loans. Using applicants income, employment
status, age, or any other demographic details will not be used and is out of scope for this
project.
Details:
The data science team at The University of Utah MSBA program will be the team working on
this project. The time frame for completion on this project will be 10 weeks. We will meet in 5
weeks to discuss initial results and provide any feedback for revisions. Important project
milestones are: Business Problem Statement, Exploratory Data Analysis, Modeling,
Presentation Draft, and Final Presentation to showcase our findings.
